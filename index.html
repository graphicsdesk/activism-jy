  After its historic 1968 campus protests, Columbia earned a critical title: the “activist Ivy.” As Columbia became the epicenter of pro-Palestinian protests last spring, garnering attention from news organizations across the country, the University emerged again as a symbol of student activism.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In April 2024, pro-Palestinian protesters pitched tents on South Lawn, posted signs marking a “Liberated zone,” and occupied Hamilton Hall—a clear callback to the monumental 1968 protests. On April 30, 2024, 56 years after the New York Police Department arrested over 700 protesters and injured 148 on Columbia’s campus, the NYPD swept the “Gaza Solidarity Encampment” and Hamilton Hall, marking the largest mass arrests on campus since 1968.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In 1968, protesters belonging to the Society of Afro-American Students and Students for a Democratic Society occupied five buildings, including the president’s office and Hamilton Hall. These occupations were in protest of the University’s plans to build a gym in Morningside Park, financial involvement in the Vietnam War, and participation in the Institute for Defense Analyses, a forum for universities and governments that fund military research to collaborate.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Though Columbia students continue to protest, with recent <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2025/03/13/ujb-issues-expulsions-degree-revocations-and-suspensions-for-hamilton-hall-occupation/?ref=compactmag.com">degree revocations, suspensions, and expulsions</a>, student protesters have described a “<a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/09/12/inside-columbias-surveillance-and-disciplinary-operation-for-student-protesters-3/">chilling effect</a>” on their activism. The federal government targeted Columbia, <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2025/03/07/trump-administration-cuts-400-million-in-federal-funding-to-columbia/">cancelling</a> $400 million in federal funding and detaining Palestinian activists for their participation in pro-Palestinian protests.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Matthew Connelly, CC ’90, professor of international and global history, said there was “no denying” that the University was the “activist Ivy.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “There are certain kinds of students; they want to be politically active, they want to be engaged, they’re not necessarily going to have the same kind of politics, but they want to be in a place where there are people who also have real commitments and care about national politics and world politics,” Connelly said. “I’m starting to think we should call ourselves the exciting Ivy.”

  Columbia prides itself on its location—boasting its ties to New York City in the very name of the institution.
</p>

  “The University recognizes the importance of its location in New York City and seeks to link its research and teaching to the vast resources of a great metropolis,” the Columbia <a href="https://plus.columbia.edu/about">website</a> reads.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  For some, one of the sources of Columbia’s activism is its expansion into West Harlem.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Columbia has <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2025/03/03/manhattanville-campus-construction-continues-into-its-17th-year/">continued</a> to expand into Morningside Heights and West Harlem with the building of its Manhattanville campus. Several West Harlem residents and community leaders have voiced concerns about the University’s<a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/city-news/2024/10/06/defend-harlem-holds-rally-against-columbias-expansion-in-harlem/"> encroachment</a> into Harlem, arguing that the University has gentrified the neighborhood.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Columbia’s relationship to Harlem has been marked by a long history of displacement and gentrification, a process that mirrors its complicity and investment in Israel’s settler-colonial project,” Palestinian activist Maryam Alwan, GS ’25, wrote in a statement to Spectator. “The University’s expansion—especially through the Manhattanville campus project—has led to the displacement of long-standing Black and Brown communities under the guise of ‘urban renewal.’”

  In October 2023, Columbia <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2023/10/23/public-safety-announces-changes-in-gate-access-to-morningside-heights-campus-ahead-of-impending-walkout/">restricted</a> campus access to Columbia ID holders, preventing non-affiliates from accessing campus. These restrictions remain in place today. Throughout the “Gaza Solidarity Encampment,” the University maintained that the gates remained closed due to security and concerns about “outside agitators”—non-affiliates who joined the protests on campus.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The fact that somebody has to be named an outside agitator suggests that there’s a world inside and there’s a world outside, and that’s the basic kind of structure of the institution, from the admissions office to the gates—there’s an inside and there’s an outside,” Reinhold Martin, professor of architecture and president of the Columbia chapter of the American Association of University Professors, said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  During the “Gaza Solidarity Encampment,” several protests featured chants and signs that advocated against Columbia’s expansion in Harlem.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Protesters from across the city arrived outside Columbia’s gates to show their solidarity with the encampment or voice concerns about the safety of Jewish students at Columbia. The NYPD arrested several protesters at these demonstrations.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The fact that people who want to protest, to join a protest effectively, or stand in solidarity with a protest outside the gates, if something’s happening inside the gates, I think it’s just the other side of that same coin,” Martin said. “It simply recognizes that this campus is in the city, and it exists in the world.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The success of schools like the Journalism School is possible because the University is situated in New York City, Martin argued, stating that there is a “long history” of the newspaper business and media being concentrated in the city.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The setting of New York City also affects the type of students who choose to attend the University.

  <b>Columbia and the classroom</b>
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The “heart of the Columbia College <a href="https://www.college.columbia.edu/core-curriculum">education</a>” is the Core Curriculum—a required set of classes all Columbia College students must take to graduate from the University.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  A unique fixture of the Columbia experience, the Core began in 1919 as one course—Contemporary Civilization—which sought to prepare “students to grapple with ‘the insistent problems of the present.’”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  During the protests,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/27/opinion/columbia-university-protests.html"> critics</a> of the Core argued that the texts that students read in Contemporary Civilization had played a role in their “narrow” understanding of the world.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The Core also unifies the largest undergraduate college within the University. Contemporary Civilization readings discuss resistance, protest movements, and civil disobedience at length, requiring students to engage with activists like Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., Frantz Fanon, and Barbara Fields.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I didn’t intend to become an activist when I came to Columbia; I wanted to use my education to help people in my future endeavors,” Alwan wrote. “But I quickly realized that the concepts of human rights and anti-colonialism that I was learning about in my classes would be meaningless without immediate action to back them up.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The Core also engages with current global issues. All Columbia College students must take Global Core courses, a requirement for which students take two classes that “engage directly with the variety of civilizations and the diversity of traditions that, along with the West, have formed the world and continue to interact in it today.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Connelly emphasized the value of the Core in empowering students to teach themselves.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “If they really engage with this work in a critical way, including a self-critical way, I think they will come back with an even more profound self-awareness of where they are and where they might be,” Connelly said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Hamilton houses the Center for the Core Curriculum, and many Columbia College students take a class in Hamilton within their first years at the University.

  Hamilton Hall became infamous during the 1968 protests as one of five buildings student protesters occupied.

  “Hamilton Hall has become a symbolic site,” Martin said. “It probably has something to do, I think, if we look at this retrospectively, with its specific standing as a kind of most emblematic building associated with the college.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Columbia has integrated its history of protest in its academic coursework, teaching it as a module in several history and American studies courses. The University now teaches a class called Columbia 1968, which is “centered on the student and community protests” of the University and Morningside Heights.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Elisha Baker, CC ’26, co-chair of Columbia Aryeh—an activist pro-Israel student group—said that Columbia “glorified” the 1968 protests, which he thinks “cemented a kind of culture that puts academic inquiry and what I believe to be the real purpose of the University, which is teaching, research, and learning, obviously, into second or third priority.”

  On April 29, 2024, Columbia College Dean Josef Sorett wrote in an email to admitted students that, “Consequently, demonstration, political activism and deep respect for freedom of expression have long been part of the fabric of our campus.”

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Throughout this past year, the unfolding conflict in Gaza has intensified the volume and tone of that activism,” Sorett wrote in his email, which came one day before the Hamilton occupation began.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Connelly noted that Columbia “features its history when recruiting students, and as a historian, I want to know, what’s wrong with that?” Connelly said. “If the history as they were presenting it was really tendentious, then I would have an issue with that. But the fact is, if they didn’t mention ’68, I would have an even bigger issue with that.”
</p>

  Chris Lanser, a college admissions counselor with IvyWise, stated that though he hasn’t worked with students who have explicitly chosen Columbia because of its student activism and engagement, some students “are going to choose Columbia because there’s stuff coming down, and they want to get in on that for a variety of reasons.”
</p>

</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Columbia certainly attracts activists—student activists and scholar activists—and I believe that this is not good for the well-being of the University because when people focus more on promoting their particular social and political agendas, they put those agendas before their primary responsibilities as educators, as engagers, and as learners,” Baker said.

  Some of Columbia’s most infamous protests have been about Columbia’s role in global conflicts and wars.
